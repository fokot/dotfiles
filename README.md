Now I'm using [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it).

So
* .bash_profile is not needed anymore
* .bash-it/aliases/custom.aliases.bash is used for my own aliases instead
* .profile is still needed for variables


And these are the configuration files to it. I have also enabled [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) bash alias, git, git-flow and dirs completitions which are parts of bash-it.

Put the files in correct bash-it folders.

[rlwrap](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap) is amazing extension what fixes problem with pressing arrows in some shells. It can be added to a shell like this
```alias lein="rlwrap lein"```
